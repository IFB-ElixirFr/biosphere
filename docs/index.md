## Welcome to Biosphere - IFB Cloud Federation for Life Science

**French Institute of Bioinformatics - IFB** is providing cloud services to analyze life science data.
These services rely on a federation of clouds - **Biosphere** - built on interconnected IT infrastructures of several IFBâ€™s platforms, 

Biosphere provides multi-cloud deployments to increase the availability of cloud resources, to propose larger CPU resources or different hardwares (GPU, big memory, high-frequency CPU), or to use different data sources. Biosphere is used for scientific production in the life sciences, developments, and to support events like scientific training and schools, university courses, hackathons or workshops.

The Biosphere portal provides different high-level cloud interfaces to analyze your data:

* [1] The [RAINBio](https://biosphere.france-bioinformatique.fr/catalogue) catalogue to select bioinformatics cloud appliances useful for your analysis,
* [2] An operating center (tab [myVM](https://biosphere.france-bioinformatique.fr/cloud)) to manage your cloud deployments with single virtual machines (VM) or complex applications with multiple VMs,
* [3] A [data center](https://biosphere.france-bioinformatique.fr/data) where you will find common public data available in the clouds.

To use the clouds of IFB-Biosphere, you need to ask for an account, and get membership of an active group (see menu `Sign in` of this documentation). Then, you will need to set up your personnal parameters [5]. And finally, you are ready to launch your VMs from the RAINBio catalogue.

The Support menu [4] provides the **current status and usage** of the whole infrastructure and the **address of our online helpdesk** to get help in case of troubles.

**Biosphere federates 8 academic clouds** deployed in regional IFB platforms:
