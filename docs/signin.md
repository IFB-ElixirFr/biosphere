We advise to use your usual academic credentials in eduGAIN where most of European universities and academic organisms are registered ([more details about eduGAIN there](https://edugain.org)). 
Biosphere will use automatically your email address and other personnal information that you authorised to transmit.

    **In case your institution is not registered in eduGAIN, you can ask for a local Biosphere account.**

* **Local Biosphere account**

You will have to fill the required information by hand. Especially, **take care of the email address** you enter because it will be use to contact you for any inquiry or announcement related to IFB-Biosphere.
For example, at the second step of the account request, an email message will be sent to this email address to confirm it.
**In case you have not anymore access to this email address, we will not be able to join you or help you to keep access to your Biosphere cloud account.**

### 2. Join a group

Once your account is created, you will be asked to apply to your affiliation/project/training group.
