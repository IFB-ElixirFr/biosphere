You will have to fill the required information by hand. Especially, **take care of the email address** you enter because it will be use to contact you for any inquiry or announcement related to IFB-Biosphere.
For example, at the second step of the account request, an email message will be sent to this email address to confirm it.
**In case you have not anymore access to this email address, we will not be able to join you or help you to keep access to your Biosphere cloud account.**
