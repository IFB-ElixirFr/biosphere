That\u2019s why we ask you to prioritize our dedicated training VM templates. These templates (\u2018ifb.tr.xxxx\u2019, where \u2018tr\u2019 stands for \"training\") are designed with a lower memory footprint, following a ratio of 1 core per 1 GB of RAM. This allows more VMs to run on a single physical server thereby reducing electricity consumption.</p> <pre><code>ifb.tr.small (1c 1Go)\nifb.tr.medium (2c 2Go)\nifb.tr.large (4c 4Go)\nifb.tr.xlarge (8c 8Go)\nifb.tr.2xlarge (16c16Go)\n</code></pre> <p>Indeed, we cannot allocate more RAM to VMs than what is physically available on the server whereas for virtual CPUs it is possible to allocate 3 to 4 times the number of physical CPUs. However, in the IFB-Biosphere clouds, the VM templates have been designed for high-performance usage. This is why the typical ratio is set to 1 computing core (1c) per 4 GB of RAM.</p> <p>Training VMs are not necessarily used continuously (e.g., during preparation or between courses). As a result, when a server hosts a large number of training VMs, the total RAM may be saturated, but the CPUs are not fully engaged.
