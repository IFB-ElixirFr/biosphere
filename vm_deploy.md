## Deploy your virtual machines (VM)

Pre-defined bioinformatics environment ('appliances') are available from the [RAINBio](https://biosphere.france-bioinformatique.fr/catalogue) catalogue. You can from there deploy your virtual environment with a single VM or several. To identify the relevant appliances, you can filter the available ones with keywords, name of tools, topics,...

Each appliance is shortly described in a box, like in the following example. The list of integrated tools and associated topics are summarized in the box [4]. There are also several actions directly usable through the following icons:

- [3] 'wrench': to configure your deployment, for example to change the used cloud and the size of the VM,
- [5] '+': to display an detailled view of the appliance (you can also click on the name of the appliance).
